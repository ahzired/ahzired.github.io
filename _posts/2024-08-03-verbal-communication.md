I don't consider myself a particularly eloquent person. I struggle to exactly word what I want to say, often conveying a different message than I meant to. For me, trying too hard to word something properly usually results in me rephrasing my thoughts until I eventually give up, or lose track of the original point. This has been an issue for me for as long as I can remember (which, to be honest, isn't very far back due to the Great Shroom Incident of '20). I notice it most when I'm trying to have serious conversations with my girlfriend, or when I'm trying to explain a problem I'm having at work. I'm much more comfortable speaking when I have sufficient time to properly word what I want to say. I think this is why I prefer communicating via text as often as possible. When I write, I can re-order my thoughts however I like. If I look back on a sentence and don't like how it's worded, I can rephrase it at my own leisure.

Unsurprisingly, I also tend to have a lot of trouble processing the things that other people say. I often don't retain anything but the broad theme of conversations with people, and have trouble understanding instructions if I can't read them. Once, back when I worked at my university's dining hall, I was tasked wth lining one of our wells with plastic wrap to make cleaning easier at the end of the day. I did so, and went back to the chef so that we could start loading up the food. He took a quick glance at the well, and said that I did it wrong. He explained what he wanted, and told me to do it again. I didn't see any difference between what he wanted and what I did, so we went through that process twice more before he yelled "Fuck it" and did it himself, while I watched trying to hold back tears. It was long enough ago that I don't remember what I was doing wrong, but I *do* remember feeling like an idiot for the rest of the day.

Ever since I realized my problems with verbal communication I try as often as I can to either write out my thoughts before speaking them, or just stick to written commnication. It's worked well enough, but I feel like my ability to speak my thoughts and understand others' is only getting worse with time. I think that it'll cause problems in both my personal and professional life, and that I'll come across some real problems if I don't work on it. My girlfriend knows this about me, and is patient enough to put up with it. While things have been okay so far, I feel like I owe it to her to work on my communication. Professionally, I don't think I'll be able to achieve my goals if I don't work on this issue. Working in the engineering field where there's such a wide variety of info you don't and will never know, teamwork is crucial in solving problems. Unfortunately, if you can't describe the problems you're having, other people can't help you solve them.

There are a couple things I want to do to practice these skills, but I'm done writing for now.
