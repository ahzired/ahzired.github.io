I've been thinking a lot about applying to law school lately. I think that I might enjoy becoming a patent attorney, for reasons that I'll get into later.

Right now, I'm just writing to kind of get myself started. I can practice multiple-choice questions on the LSAT easily enough, but argumentative writing has never been my strong suit. When I find myself with a bit more time, I want to take some old samples and respond to them, as if I were actually taking the LSAT.

Will do later.
