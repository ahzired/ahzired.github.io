This recipe was stolen from a reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBaking/comments/nejohq/bagels_whats_the_deal/gyigwkh/), which in turn was taken from [this](https://www.amazon.com/Blessing-Bread-Traditions-Jewish-Baking/dp/1579652107) cookbook. It includes a lot of things I don't have like bagel boards and bagel stones, so I did my best with just a regular sheetpan. Unsure how much it affects the recipe, I'm making it for the first time right now!

# Ingredients
- 900g high gluten flour (such as bread flour)
- 40g nondiastatic malt powder[^1]
- 18g salt
- 1/2 tsp (1.4g) instant yeast
- 505g cold water
- Cornmeal for dusting pans and toppings


[^1]: According to a post on the King Arthur Baking website, malt syrup can be used as a substitute for non-diastatic malt powder: "Or, you could use 0.8 gram diastatic malt powder for every 1 gram barley malt syrup in the dough.". I couldn't find any malt powder OR syrup, so I used molasses. Going opposite of their recommendation, I used 20% more molasses than I would malt powder (50g).

# Instructions
- Mix flour, malt, salt and yeast together with a whisk so everything is nicely combined. You may want to sift it, it can get clumpy.
- Add the water and maybe slosh it around a bit in the mixer to get it a bit more incorporated.
- Mix on low speed for 3-5 minutes with dough hook, take a break and then mix up to 10 minutes total (so an additional 5-7 min) or so on speed 2.
- Form 8 bagels (6oz each) and place on cornmeal dusted boards and cover with plastic wrap.
- Cover and let rest for about 2 hours at room temp
- Put in the refrigerator for a while 12hr->2 days. The longer in the refrigerator, the more blisters you get and a better flavor.
- Oven at 425.
- Bring to a boil a pot of plain water and boil the bagels for about 30 seconds each side straight from the fridge (boil them just until they float basically)
- Add toppings if desired, then place corn-meal side up on a pan with parchment paper.
- Bake for 4-5 minutes, then flip bagels and bake another ~15-25 minutes depending on how dark you like the bagels.
