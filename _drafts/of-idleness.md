In an attempt to start reading more books outside of my comfort zone, I recently bought a collection of Michel de Montaigne's *Essays*. I may write about them sometime in the future, but I'd like to first reflect on each individual essay before I make any attempt to write about the collection as a whole.
- [ ] clarify wanting to write about "them"

The first essay in the collection is titled "Of Idleness". In it, Montaigne compares the mind to fallow farmland; the land is rich, but provides no real benefit to an owner that does not work to cultivate it. He realized this when, in his old age, he retired to his family property with the goal of living out the rest of his life idly, in rest and privacy. He says, "it seemed to me I could do my mind no greator favor than to let it entertain itself in idleness and stay and settle in itself, which I hoped it might do more easily now, having become heavier and more mature with time." 

While certainly to a lesser degree than Montaigne, I felt the same way when I finished university. I enjoyed school and loved learning about electrical engineering, but it was stressful - much more so than I realized as I was doing it. I thought that I wanted an easy job; one where work occupies no space in my mind outside of typical working hours. My reasoning was that with a well paying, unstressful job I could focus more on myself and do the things that I had always wanted to do. To a certain extent, I still believe that. Occasionally though, I found myself wishing that I were doing something different. When I first started, I wished that I was part of the design team, rather than validation. I tried building a project to develop my digital design skills, which I quickly lost interest in. I later found myself interested in the hardware architecture of the chips that we're working on, and started considering whether or not I would ever go back for a PhD. I'm still unsure about a PhD, but those aspirations of becoming a hardware architect have since tamed. Recently, I've been considering how I would feel about going to law school to become a patent attorney. I still thnk it's something I might enjoy, but it's very possible that I'm simply in the middle of a phase like I was for design and architecture. Long story short, I've often found myself dissatisfied with my career choice because of its simplicity. I've had other, more personal thoughts that follow a theme of dissatisfaction with my current life as well. My mind tends to wander into thoughts of what could have been, and what can still be. 

Montaigne might have predicted this; he claims that *quote about chimera*. When he himself tried to "let [his mind] entertain itself in idleness," he sees that
*quote after the first one I wrote*.
